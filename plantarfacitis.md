# Mo plantar facitis protocol
Plantar fasciitis is very painful and is often caused due to too much running or strenuous activity. (Young et al, 2001) describe the pain is "usually caused by collagen degeneration at the origin of the plantar fascia at the medial tubercle of the calcaneus" and a visual diagram is shown in Figure 1. The role of the plantar fascia is for foot arch support.

## Treatment protocol based on research
This protocol is a long protocol that will have to become part of ones daily routine

### Stretching & Strengthening
My line manager recommended stretching. (Young et al, 2001) provide figures as shown below of stretches to do (Figures 2-8). Stretching the calves can help loosen the plantar fascia as well as help strengthen it. Doing things such as Dynamic stretching and massaging the plantar fascia can help remove scar tissue and build the connective tissue.

### Shoes 
Consider buying flat feet or high arch feet shoes. If you have flat feet arch taping and buying arch supports can help with flare ups. 

You may also want to consider using night splints which are designed to keep your ankle up overnight. This is to prevent the plantar from being flexed while sleeping (as shown in Figure 9)

## Drugs - contains WADA banned substances
I personally do not take any substances for my plantar fascitis because I want to one day compete in sports naturally. 
### Legal 
With a doctors supervision and approval, NSAIDS, iontophoresis (electric impluse treatment) and cortisone injections have been shown to be effective in treating plantar fascitis.

### Grey area
Testosterone injections. You may be able to get a prescription from your doctor if you are hypogonadal. Testosterone and other SARMS / SERMS are banned by WADA so you cannot take this if you are competing. 

BPC-157 is a healing peptide which has been shown to be extremely effective for treating injuries. However, it is not legal to purchase in the UK and is banned by WADA. It also increases the chances of getting cancer.
